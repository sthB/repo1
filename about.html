                    The wild mountain and vast landscape of countryside has always 
            been close to Bimal Shresthaâ€™s heart. Growing up in beautiful village of 
            southern Nepal and working in farm with his grandfather, he developed 
            his  love for  outdoor  in his early age. His passion for art   has
            always  focused  on  affection  for the   untrammeled  country  life.
            Bimal Spent much of his youth hiking   and painting  in the mountain 
            wilderness. He gives credit to his grandfather for influencing him in 
            art.He started painting with brushes made out of bamboo stick and pigments 
            collected in countryside by his grandfather. A devotion in art was obvious
            at an early age. Bimal moved to United State in 2007 and started painting 
            as a part time while continuing his engineering career. He is also affiliated
            with prestigious art organization CAC( California Art Club) and OPA(Oil 
            Painters of America). Bimal paints at his Hayward  studio and travels 
            frequently for  pleinair painting. </center>
